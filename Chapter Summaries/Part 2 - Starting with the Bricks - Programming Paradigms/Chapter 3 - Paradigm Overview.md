# Chapter 3: Paradigm Overview

- Paradigms: Ways of programming. Tell you what programming structures to use and when to use them.
- The three paradigms are:
  - **Structured Programming:** _Structured programming imposes discipline on direct transfer of control._
  - **Object-Oriented Programming:** _Object-oriented programming imposes discipline on indirect transfer of control._
  - **Functional Programming:** _Functional programming imposes discipline upon assignment._
