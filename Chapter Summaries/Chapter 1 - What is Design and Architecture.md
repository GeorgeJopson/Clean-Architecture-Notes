# Chapter 1: What is Design and Architecture

- Design is simply a continuum of decisions from low-level to high-level that we have to make about the functioning of our system.
- _The goal of software architecture is to minimise the human resources required to build and maintain the required system._
- If effort to make changes is low and stays low throughout the lifetime of projects then you have good design. However if effort to make changes starts exploding, your design is flawed.
- _The only way to go fast, is to go well._ The notion that writing messy code can help you go fast in the short term for a decrease in speed in the long term, is flawed. Writing messy code will slow you down over any time frame.
- Avoid overconfidence in thinking that you can move quickly. Being patient, careful, and respectful of your software architecture is the only way that you can actually move quickly.
