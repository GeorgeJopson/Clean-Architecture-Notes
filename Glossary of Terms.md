# Glossary of Terms

_These are useful definitions of terms (not necessarily taken from the book, but from wider research)._

- **Enclosing Scope:** The scope of the enclosing (outer) function, if the current function is nested inside another function. Part of the LEGB rule which is the order in which python looks up variable names (local, enclosing, global, built-in).
- **Polymorphism:** The concept in OOP that you can access objects of different types through the same interface. Each type can provide its own independent implementation of this interface. (Definition taken from: https://stackify.com/oop-concept-polymorphism/)
